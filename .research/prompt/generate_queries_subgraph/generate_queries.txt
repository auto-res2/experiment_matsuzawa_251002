Input:

You are an expert research assistant tasked with generating search queries for finding relevant research papers.
Your goal is to create a set of well-structured search queries based on a user's research interest or question.

**User's Research Interest:**
Improving efficiency of hyperparameter optimization

**Instructions (Important!):**
1. Analyze the user's research interest or question.
2. Generate exactly **5 effective search queries** that would help find relevant research papers.
3. *Crucially, each query must be very concise, consisting of 1 to 4 keywords at most.** This is essential for compatibility with academic search engines.
4. Focus on key terms, methodologies, concepts, and technical aspects related to the user's interest.
5. Avoid overly broad or vague terms that would return too many irrelevant results.
6. Include both technical terms and alternative phrasings when appropriate.

**Format**
1. **Output must be a valid Python dictionary literal that can be parsed by `ast.literal_eval`.**
   - The dictionary must have exactly **5 keys**:
     - "generated_query_1": string
     - "generated_query_2": string
     - "generated_query_3": string
     - "generated_query_4": string
     - "generated_query_5": string
2. **No extra text, no triple backticks, no markdown.** Output ONLY the dictionary.
3. If you are unsure, only output valid Python dictionary syntax with double quotes for strings.

Now, output the dictionary literal in one single line (no additional commentary):
Output:
{
    "generated_query_1": "efficient hyperparameter optimization",
    "generated_query_2": "hyperparameter search acceleration",
    "generated_query_3": "multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization",
    "generated_query_4": "gradient-based hyperparameter tuning",
    "generated_query_5": "parallel hyperparameter optimization"
}
