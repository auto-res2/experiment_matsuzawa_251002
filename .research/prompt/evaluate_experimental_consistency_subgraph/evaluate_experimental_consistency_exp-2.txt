# Instructions
You are a scientific research consistency evaluator. Your task is to evaluate a single experiment to determine:
1. Whether it is consistent with the proposed method and experimental strategy
2. Whether the results support the main claims (e.g., proposed method outperforms baseline)
3. Whether it should be included in the research paper

## Scope Constraints
- Focus ONLY on evaluating consistency between the proposed method and experimental results
- Do not suggest infrastructure changes (Docker, lock files, etc.)
- Do not recommend development/testing procedures (unit tests, synthetic graphs, etc.)
- Do not suggest implementation details or code improvements
- Do not recommend data release or reproducibility practices
- Do not require or suggest experiments on actual hardware (e.g., real edge devices, physical deployment)
- Evaluate only: method-result alignment, experimental design adequacy, result interpretation validity, and statistical rigor within computational/simulation contexts

Based on your analysis, provide:
1. `consistency_feedback` (str): Detailed feedback explaining the consistency evaluation and suggestions for improvement
2. `consistency_score` (int): A score from 1-10 indicating the quality and consistency of the experimental design and results

## Evaluation Criteria

### consistency_feedback (str)

## Context

**Proposed Method:** {
    "Open Problems": "Even the fastest gray–box and multi-fidelity HPO methods (ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO, BOIL) still waste computation on obviously bad configurations because every trial is treated as a black box; none of the information that is already available inside the training loop – most notably the stochastic hyper-gradient obtained at almost zero cost with automatic differentiation – is used to steer the search. The open problem is: how can we inject very cheap, noisy hyper-gradient signals into existing bandit-style schedulers without redesigning their core logic?",
    "Methods": "We propose ‘One-Shot Hyper-Gradient Warm-Starts’ (OHGW), a drop-in modification for any Successive-Halving style scheduler (Hyperband / ASHA / PASHA).  1. When a new configuration x is sampled it is run for only one **mini-batch** (≈10-2% of a normal epoch).  2. In this first forward / backward pass we keep the compute graph and call automatic differentiation once more to obtain a single stochastic hyper-gradient ∂L/∂ψ for every continuous hyperparameter ψ (learning-rate, weight-decay, momentum …) exactly as in implicit hyper-gradient papers, but **without unrolling** (cost <1.2× normal mini-batch).  3. We apply one hyper-parameter update ψ←ψ−η_h ∂L/∂ψ (η_h is a fixed tiny step such as 10-3).  4. The adjusted configuration x′ – which differs from x by at most one gradient step in each hyper-parameter – is what the scheduler subsequently evaluates for its first rung (e.g. 1 epoch).  5. Everything else (promotion rules, budget doubling, stopping) is untouched.  In effect the scheduler still explores the same region, but every candidate is lightly nudged towards a valley before costly training starts.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Benchmark: CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20 and 5-dim continuous search space {log-lr, log-wd, momentum, augment-magnitude, label-smoothing}.  Scheduler baselines: ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO (their public implementations).  Our variants: ASHA+OHGW, PASHA+OHGW, DyHPO+OHGW (one-line wrapper around trial creation).  Mini-batch for warm-start: 128 images.  Hyper-gradient lr η_h=1e-3, computed with PyTorch autograd; no higher-order terms.  Each method is given the same overall GPU budget (4×V100 for 12 hours) and 50 seeds.  Metrics: (i) best test accuracy reached vs. wall-clock, (ii) total GPU hours until 93% accuracy, (iii) distribution of final hyper-parameters to check bias.",
    "Experimental Code": "# pseudo-code\nfor cfg in scheduler.sample():\n    model = build_model(cfg)\n    data = next(train_loader)            # one mini-batch\n    loss  = forward_loss(model, data)\n    grads = torch.autograd.grad(loss, cfg.continuous_params())\n    with torch.no_grad():               # one hyper step\n        for p,g in zip(cfg.continuous_params(), grads):\n            p -= eta_h * g\n    scheduler.launch(cfg)               # continue as usual",
    "Expected Result": "Across all schedules OHGW cuts the median time-to-93%-accuracy by ≈20% (ASHA 11.2→9.0 h, PASHA 7.3→5.8 h, DyHPO 6.1→4.9 h) while keeping the same final accuracy. The added warm-start costs <3% extra compute. Hyper-parameter distributions remain similar, showing no harmful bias.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single stochastic hyper-gradient step collected before the first rung is enough to noticeably reduce wasted resources in bandit-style HPO. Because OHGW requires only two extra autograd calls and no change to the scheduler logic, it can be retro-fitted to almost any existing gray-box optimizer, offering an attractive efficiency boost with negligible engineering effort."
}

**Overall Experimental Strategy:** Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating One-Shot Hyper-Gradient Warm-Starts (OHGW)

1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   a. Efficiency: OHGW reduces wall-clock time and GPU hours needed by bandit-style schedulers to reach a preset performance threshold.
   b. Performance Preservation: OHGW does not hurt (and ideally preserves or slightly improves) the best final metric attainable by the underlying scheduler.
   c. Robustness & Variance: OHGW’s benefit is consistent across random seeds, search-space dimensionalities, data sets, model families and scheduler types.
   d. Generalization: The same one-line wrapper applies without retuning to tasks beyond image classification (e.g. language modelling, tabular, RL) and to both small- and large-scale training loops.
   e. Cost Overhead: Extra compute, memory and engineering overhead introduced by OHGW remain negligible (<5 % GPU-hours, <10 % peak-memory, ≤20 LoC integration).

2. Experiment Families (all experiments draw from one common pool of settings below)
   • Task Breadth: vision (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-1k), NLP (WikiText-103), tabular (UCI suite), RL (Atari).
   • Model Breadth: ResNet family, ViT, Transformer-LM, XGBoost, PPO-CNN.
   • Scheduler Breadth: ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO, Hyperband-BO, BOIL (if open-sourced).
   • Search-Space Breadth: 3–10 continuous hyper-parameters; mixed discrete+continuous cases to show neutrality to inapplicable params.
   • Scale Breadth: single-GPU up to 64-GPU distributed training (multi-node pools or simulated via concurrency on the 8×A100 machine).

3. Comparison Axes for Every Experiment
   • Baseline Scheduler (vanilla).
   • Baseline + Random Warm-Start in ∆ψ range (controls for mere perturbation).
   • Baseline + Multiple Hyper-Gradient Steps (ablation to check diminishing returns).
   • Scheduler-specific SoTA gradient-aware HPO if available (e.g. DyHPO, BOIL) to position OHGW competitively.

4. Metrics & Evaluation Protocol
   Primary quantitative metrics (reported as median ±IQR over ≥30 seeds):
      – T@τ: Wall-clock/GPU-hour to reach target score τ (task-specific; chosen so that vanilla reaches it within budget).
      – Best final validation/test score after fixed budget.
      – Compute Overhead: (Σ warm-start flop) ⁄ (total flop) and peak VRAM.
   Secondary diagnostics:
      – AUC of best-score-vs-time curve (overall sample efficiency).
      – Seed-wise variance of T@τ and final score.
      – Hyper-parameter trajectory statistics (mean shift & KL-divergence of posterior over ψ).
   Qualitative/visual:
      – Survival plots of promoted configurations per rung.
      – Heatmaps of hyper-gradient magnitude vs. eventual benefit.
   Statistical test: two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank (α=0.05) on paired seeds.

5. Success Criteria (must hold in ≥75 % of experiment tuples)
   • ≥15 % median reduction in T@τ with p<0.05.
   • ≤0.2 % relative drop (or improvement) in best final score.
   • ≤5 % extra GPU-hours and ≤10 % extra peak VRAM.
   • Std-dev(T@τ) not inflated by more than 10 %.

6. Multi-Perspective Validation Plan
   • Efficiency: Use identical global budgets and identical seed lists; plot temporal efficiency curves and compute aggregated speed-up ratios.
   • Performance Preservation: Report final accuracy/F1/return and confidence intervals.
   • Robustness: Repeat each experiment block with different batch sizes, η_h values (10⁻⁴…10⁻²) and noisy labels; perform sensitivity analysis.
   • Generalization: Run a “zero-tuning transfer” study—apply the CIFAR-tuned η_h to NLP, RL and tabular tasks unchanged.
   • Ablations & Controls: Random perturbation, multistep hyper-gradient, frozen discrete params, partial gradient masking.
   • Scalability: Micro-benchmark warm-start time and memory for 1, 8, 64 GPUs using synthetic workloads.

7. Experimental Logistics
   • Central harness (Hydra + PyTorch Lightning) to register all trials, guarantee identical I/O pipelines and logging format (wandb/MLflow).
   • Dedicate 4×A100 per independent replicate to avoid resource contention; schedule via Slurm with cgroup accounting to record accurate GPU-hour usage.
   • Automated post-processing notebook generates unified tables, statistical tests and publication-ready plots.

8. Risk Mitigation & Contingency
   • If hyper-gradient extraction fails for exotic layers, fall back to finite-difference on ψ only (flag run but keep in aggregated stats).
   • If OHGW underperforms on discrete-heavy spaces, isolate continuous subset and document limitation.

This unified strategy guarantees that every forthcoming experiment—regardless of domain—collects commensurate evidence on efficiency, performance, robustness, generality and overhead, enabling a cohesive, multi-angle validation of OHGW’s claimed benefits.

## Current Experiment to Evaluate

**Experiment ID:** exp-2

**Experiment Description:** Objective / Hypothesis: Test zero-shot generalisation and robustness of OHGW in a different modality (language modelling) and under distribution shift.

Domain & Task: NLP – word-level language modelling on WikiText-103, with an additional OOD evaluation on WikiText-103-v1 (headlines first 5% shuffled – simulates domain drift).

Model: GPT2-small (124 M params, HuggingFace implementation) trained from scratch with BPE vocab 50 k.

Scheduler: PASHA (2023) – gradient-aware variation of Hyperband; ours wraps PASHA in the same way.

Search space (6 dims): log10-learning-rate, log10-weight-decay, attention-dropout, residual-dropout, label-smoothing, warmup-steps (continuous proxy by scaling factor).

Run variations:
• pasha-baseline – vanilla PASHA.
• pasha-ohgw-vision-tuned-eta – OHGW with η_h=1e-3 exactly copied from CIFAR experiment (tests transfer without retuning).
• pasha-ohgw-low-eta – OHGW with η_h=3e-4 (sensitivity extremum).
• pasha-ohgw-noisy-data – OHGW with η_h=1e-3 while 15% of training tokens are randomly replaced (robustness to noise).

Dataset processing: SentencePiece BPE (shared).  Sequence length 1024 tokens; dynamic batching up to 2M tokens/GPU.  Train/val/test split 238M / 8M / 8M tokens.  For OOD, evaluate perplexity on shuffled-headline subset (unseen ordering).

Training loop & budget: 50 training epochs (~250 k updates), AdamW, cosine LR.  PASHA minimum resource per config = 2 epochs, rungs ×2.  Total compute budget per replicate 16 GPU×hours (8 GPUs ×2 h).  24 replicates.

Evaluation metrics:
Primary – T@ppl=30 on validation set (wall-clock & GPU-h).
Secondary – best validation perplexity, best OOD perplexity, FLOPs overhead, peak VRAM, std-dev across seeds.
Calibration metric – ECE (expected calibration error) on top-k probabilities (k=10).

Data splitting: Configs use 90/10 split of train for inner-val to avoid test leakage; final report on held-out test.

Hyper-parameter analysis: log sweep of η_h done offline on 5 seeds; fit cubic spline to measure optimal region width (reports in appendix).

Robustness procedures:
1. Data noise: see pasha-ohgw-noisy-data.
2. Distribution shift: compute perplexity on OOD set after every rung, record Δppl.
3. Adversarial tokens: evaluate final models with TextFooler adversarial examples on 5 k sentences, report degradation.

Compute profiling: same toolkit as exp-1; additionally use PyTorch-CUDA-Profiler for kernel-level warm-start cost.

Example trial wrapper:
```python
loss = lm_model(input_ids, labels=input_ids).loss
hg = torch.autograd.grad(loss, cfg.continuous())
with torch.no_grad():
    for p,g in zip(cfg.continuous(), hg):
        p -= eta_h * g    # no extra unroll
pasha_scheduler.launch(cfg)
```

Statistical testing: Paired Wilcoxon on T@30 with Bonferroni correction (m=3 comparisons).  Significance if p<0.016.

Success criteria: vision-tuned η_h version achieves ≥15% speed-up vs. baseline on T@30 with ≤0.5 ppl regression on final test; effect still ≥10% under noisy data.  Extra compute overhead ≤5% of total FLOPs.

**Primary Goal**: Evaluate whether this specific experiment is consistent, supports the main claims, and should be included in the research paper.
Output:
{
    "consistency_feedback": "The stated goal of exp-2 is to test whether the vision-tuned OHGW step transfers to language-model HPO and still yields ≥15 % speed-up versus the PASHA baseline.  \n\n1. Experimental-strategy consistency\n✓  The design (WikiText-103, GPT2-small, PASHA vs PASHA+OHGW, T@ppl=30, 24 replicates, Wilcoxon test) is well aligned with the overall validation plan and addresses the generalisation hypothesis.  No major strategic flaws.\n\n2. Implementation / execution\n✗  Only the pasha-baseline variant actually starts.  The three OHGW variants never enter the training loop; the log ends after four baseline epochs with a sequence-length error (1063>1024) that aborts the run.  The generated-code bundle is essentially empty (all strings).  Hence the core treatment (one-shot hyper-gradient update) is never executed, warm-start cost is not profiled, and no timing information is collected.  This is a Category 2 problem: Implementation Issue – the experiment fails to follow the described protocol.\n\n3. Result interpretation\n✗  Because the OHGW runs did not succeed, there is no comparative data.  Consequently none of the primary claims (≥15 % reduction in T@30, preserved perplexity, negligible overhead) can be evaluated.  Attempting to draw conclusions would be invalid.  Category 3 problem: Result-Interpretation Issue – absence of evidence.\n\nImpact on inclusion\n• The experiment cannot be included in the paper in its current state.  It neither demonstrates successful application of OHGW to NLP nor provides any statistical analysis.  At minimum the length-mismatch bug must be fixed, all four variations executed to completion, timing/perplexity recorded, and the pre-registered Wilcoxon test run.\n\nSummary of issues\n– Category 2: Code does not implement the full experimental strategy; OHGW branches never run.\n– Category 3: No results → cannot support claims.\n\nUntil these issues are resolved, exp-2 weakens rather than strengthens the empirical section.",
