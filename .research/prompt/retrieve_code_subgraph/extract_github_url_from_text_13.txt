# Paper Outline
DyHPO employs a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with a novel deep kernel. This deep kernel (K) uses a neural network (φ) to process the hyperparameter configuration (x), current budget (j), and the past learning curve (Y). The network φ concatenates a linear transformation of normalized budget and hyperparameter configuration with a one-dimensional convolution and max pooling of the learning curve. A squared exponential kernel (k) is then applied to the output of φ. The model parameters are optimized via maximum likelihood using Adam. DyHPO extends Expected Improvement (EI) to Multi-Fidelity Expected Improvement (EIMF), which dynamically selects the next configuration and budget (incrementing by one step) to train based on the surrogate's predictions, prioritizing exploration by slowly increasing the budget.
