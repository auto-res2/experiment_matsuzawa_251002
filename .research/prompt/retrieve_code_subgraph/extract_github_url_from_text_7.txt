Input:
# Task
You carefully read the contents of the “Paper Outline” and select one GitHub link from the “GitHub URLs List” that you think is most relevant to the contents.
# Constraints
- Output the index number corresponding to the selected GitHub URL.
- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
DPL models learning curves as power law functions: `f̂(λ, b) = g(λ)α + g(λ)β * b^(-g(λ)γ)`, where `g` is a parametric neural network mapping hyperparameter configurations `λ` to the power law coefficients `α, β, γ`, and `b` is the budget (epochs). An ensemble of K such neural networks is trained to provide probabilistic predictions (mean `μ` and variance `σ²`). Bayesian Optimization (BO) with an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function is used to recommend the next hyperparameter configuration `λN+1`. Instead of running `λN+1` to full convergence, a multi-fidelity strategy incrementally advances it by a small budget `b_step` (e.g., one epoch). The network is a 2-layer feedforward neural network with 128 units per layer, Leaky ReLU, and GLU non-linearity on `β` and `γ` output units, trained with L1 loss and Adam.
