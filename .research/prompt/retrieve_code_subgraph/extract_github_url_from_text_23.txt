- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
The methodology comprises theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and benchmark experiments. The theoretical analysis investigates the effect of reshuffling on the empirical loss surface by deriving the limiting distribution of the validation loss, modeling it as a zero-mean Gaussian process and providing a bound on the expected regret. The simulation study uses a univariate quadratic loss surface with a squared exponential kernel for the noise process to systematically vary curvature, noise correlation, and reshuffling extent. Benchmark experiments utilize random search and state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization (BO) variants (HEBO, SMAC3) to evaluate different resampling strategies (holdout, M-fold CV, M-fold holdout, 5x 5-fold CV) with and without reshuffling.
