# Paper Outline
AUTOMATA integrates three core components: a hyper-parameter search algorithm (e.g., Random Search, TPE) to identify configurations, a gradient-based subset selection (GSS) algorithm for efficient configuration evaluation, and a hyper-parameter scheduling algorithm (e.g., Hyperband, ASHA) for early stopping. The GSS method selects a subset and associated weights such that the weighted subset loss gradient best approximates the entire training loss gradient, formulated as an optimization problem and solved using a greedy algorithm like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). A 'per-batch' variant of GSS is used for efficiency, selecting subsets of mini-batches. Additionally, 'warm-starting' involves initial training on the entire dataset for a few epochs to obtain informative loss gradients, particularly when using the ASHA scheduler.
