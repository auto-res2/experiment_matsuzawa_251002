# Paper Outline
DyHPO is a Bayesian Optimization approach based on Gaussian Processes (GP). It employs a deep kernel GP (K) that models the validation score (fi,j) based on the hyperparameter configuration (xi), budget (j), and the past learning curve (Yi,j-1). The deep kernel uses a neural network (φ) as a feature extractor, which consists of linear and convolutional layers. The budget is normalized and concatenated with the hyperparameter configuration, while the learning curve is processed by a one-dimensional convolution followed by global max pooling. Both representations are then combined and fed to another linear layer, whose output is used by a squared exponential kernel (k). The optimal parameters for the kernel and neural network are found by maximizing the likelihood. For acquisition, DyHPO introduces a Multi-Fidelity Expected Improvement (EIMF) function, which extends standard EI by dynamically defining the incumbent best score (ymax_j) based on whether observations exist for the current budget j or for any budget. The algorithm dynamically selects the most promising candidate to train for one additional budget step and updates the surrogate model with the new observation.
