Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "Even the fastest gray–box and multi-fidelity HPO methods (ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO, BOIL) still waste computation on obviously bad configurations because every trial is treated as a black box; none of the information that is already available inside the training loop – most notably the stochastic hyper-gradient obtained at almost zero cost with automatic differentiation – is used to steer the search. The open problem is: how can we inject very cheap, noisy hyper-gradient signals into existing bandit-style schedulers without redesigning their core logic?",
    "Methods": "We propose ‘One-Shot Hyper-Gradient Warm-Starts’ (OHGW), a drop-in modification for any Successive-Halving style scheduler (Hyperband / ASHA / PASHA).  1. When a new configuration x is sampled it is run for only one **mini-batch** (≈10-2% of a normal epoch).  2. In this first forward / backward pass we keep the compute graph and call automatic differentiation once more to obtain a single stochastic hyper-gradient ∂L/∂ψ for every continuous hyperparameter ψ (learning-rate, weight-decay, momentum …) exactly as in implicit hyper-gradient papers, but **without unrolling** (cost <1.2× normal mini-batch).  3. We apply one hyper-parameter update ψ←ψ−η_h ∂L/∂ψ (η_h is a fixed tiny step such as 10-3).  4. The adjusted configuration x′ – which differs from x by at most one gradient step in each hyper-parameter – is what the scheduler subsequently evaluates for its first rung (e.g. 1 epoch).  5. Everything else (promotion rules, budget doubling, stopping) is untouched.  In effect the scheduler still explores the same region, but every candidate is lightly nudged towards a valley before costly training starts.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Benchmark: CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20 and 5-dim continuous search space {log-lr, log-wd, momentum, augment-magnitude, label-smoothing}.  Scheduler baselines: ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO (their public implementations).  Our variants: ASHA+OHGW, PASHA+OHGW, DyHPO+OHGW (one-line wrapper around trial creation).  Mini-batch for warm-start: 128 images.  Hyper-gradient lr η_h=1e-3, computed with PyTorch autograd; no higher-order terms.  Each method is given the same overall GPU budget (4×V100 for 12 hours) and 50 seeds.  Metrics: (i) best test accuracy reached vs. wall-clock, (ii) total GPU hours until 93% accuracy, (iii) distribution of final hyper-parameters to check bias.",
    "Experimental Code": "# pseudo-code\nfor cfg in scheduler.sample():\n    model = build_model(cfg)\n    data = next(train_loader)            # one mini-batch\n    loss  = forward_loss(model, data)\n    grads = torch.autograd.grad(loss, cfg.continuous_params())\n    with torch.no_grad():               # one hyper step\n        for p,g in zip(cfg.continuous_params(), grads):\n            p -= eta_h * g\n    scheduler.launch(cfg)               # continue as usual",
    "Expected Result": "Across all schedules OHGW cuts the median time-to-93%-accuracy by ≈20% (ASHA 11.2→9.0 h, PASHA 7.3→5.8 h, DyHPO 6.1→4.9 h) while keeping the same final accuracy. The added warm-start costs <3% extra compute. Hyper-parameter distributions remain similar, showing no harmful bias.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single stochastic hyper-gradient step collected before the first rung is enough to noticeably reduce wasted resources in bandit-style HPO. Because OHGW requires only two extra autograd calls and no change to the scheduler logic, it can be retro-fitted to almost any existing gray-box optimizer, offering an attractive efficiency boost with negligible engineering effort."

    "experiment_strategy": "Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating One-Shot Hyper-Gradient Warm-Starts (OHGW)\n\n1. Core Hypotheses to Validate\n   a. Efficiency: OHGW reduces wall-clock time and GPU hours needed by bandit-style schedulers to reach a preset performance threshold.\n   b. Performance Preservation: OHGW does not hurt (and ideally preserves or slightly improves) the best final metric attainable by the underlying scheduler.\n   c. Robustness & Variance: OHGW’s benefit is consistent across random seeds, search-space dimensionalities, data sets, model families and scheduler types.\n   d. Generalization: The same one-line wrapper applies without retuning to tasks beyond image classification (e.g. language modelling, tabular, RL) and to both small- and large-scale training loops.\n   e. Cost Overhead: Extra compute, memory and engineering overhead introduced by OHGW remain negligible (<5 % GPU-hours, <10 % peak-memory, ≤20 LoC integration).\n\n2. Experiment Families (all experiments draw from one common pool of settings below)\n   • Task Breadth: vision (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-1k), NLP (WikiText-103), tabular (UCI suite), RL (Atari).\n   • Model Breadth: ResNet family, ViT, Transformer-LM, XGBoost, PPO-CNN.\n   • Scheduler Breadth: ASHA, PASHA, DyHPO, Hyperband-BO, BOIL (if open-sourced).\n   • Search-Space Breadth: 3–10 continuous hyper-parameters; mixed discrete+continuous cases to show neutrality to inapplicable params.\n   • Scale Breadth: single-GPU up to 64-GPU distributed training (multi-node pools or simulated via concurrency on the 8×A100 machine).\n\n3. Comparison Axes for Every Experiment\n   • Baseline Scheduler (vanilla).\n   • Baseline + Random Warm-Start in ∆ψ range (controls for mere perturbation).\n   • Baseline + Multiple Hyper-Gradient Steps (ablation to check diminishing returns).\n   • Scheduler-specific SoTA gradient-aware HPO if available (e.g. DyHPO, BOIL) to position OHGW competitively.\n\n4. Metrics & Evaluation Protocol\n   Primary quantitative metrics (reported as median ±IQR over ≥30 seeds):\n      – T@τ: Wall-clock/GPU-hour to reach target score τ (task-specific; chosen so that vanilla reaches it within budget).\n      – Best final validation/test score after fixed budget.\n      – Compute Overhead: (Σ warm-start flop) ⁄ (total flop) and peak VRAM.\n   Secondary diagnostics:\n      – AUC of best-score-vs-time curve (overall sample efficiency).\n      – Seed-wise variance of T@τ and final score.\n      – Hyper-parameter trajectory statistics (mean shift & KL-divergence of posterior over ψ).\n   Qualitative/visual:\n      – Survival plots of promoted configurations per rung.\n      – Heatmaps of hyper-gradient magnitude vs. eventual benefit.\n   Statistical test: two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank (α=0.05) on paired seeds.\n\n5. Success Criteria (must hold in ≥75 % of experiment tuples)\n   • ≥15 % median reduction in T@τ with p<0.05.\n   • ≤0.2 % relative drop (or improvement) in best final score.\n   • ≤5 % extra GPU-hours and ≤10 % extra peak VRAM.\n   • Std-dev(T@τ) not inflated by more than 10 %.\n\n6. Multi-Perspective Validation Plan\n   • Efficiency: Use identical global budgets and identical seed lists; plot temporal efficiency curves and compute aggregated speed-up ratios.\n   • Performance Preservation: Report final accuracy/F1/return and confidence intervals.\n   • Robustness: Repeat each experiment block with different batch sizes, η_h values (10⁻⁴…10⁻²) and noisy labels; perform sensitivity analysis.\n   • Generalization: Run a “zero-tuning transfer” study—apply the CIFAR-tuned η_h to NLP, RL and tabular tasks unchanged.\n   • Ablations & Controls: Random perturbation, multistep hyper-gradient, frozen discrete params, partial gradient masking.\n   • Scalability: Micro-benchmark warm-start time and memory for 1, 8, 64 GPUs using synthetic workloads.\n\n7. Experimental Logistics\n   • Central harness (Hydra + PyTorch Lightning) to register all trials, guarantee identical I/O pipelines and logging format (wandb/MLflow).\n   • Dedicate 4×A100 per independent replicate to avoid resource contention; schedule via Slurm with cgroup accounting to record accurate GPU-hour usage.\n   • Automated post-processing notebook generates unified tables, statistical tests and publication-ready plots.\n\n8. Risk Mitigation & Contingency\n   • If hyper-gradient extraction fails for exotic layers, fall back to finite-difference on ψ only (flag run but keep in aggregated stats).\n   • If OHGW underperforms on discrete-heavy spaces, isolate continuous subset and document limitation.\n\nThis unified strategy guarantees that every forthcoming experiment—regardless of domain—collects commensurate evidence on efficiency, performance, robustness, generality and overhead, enabling a cohesive, multi-angle validation of OHGW’s claimed benefits."
